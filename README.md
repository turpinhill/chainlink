# Project Name: KHYPE
The KHYPE project is an extensible educational module that uses assistive technology to enable students to learn empirical planent data while exploring the Milky Way planetarium in a virutal reality. The funding module uses a donation NFT for Educational Enrichment and potential deductability for contributions. The current educational module can be found at the decentralized website [here](https://turpinhill.eth.link). We have two persons (US Citizens) that are credited with the creation of the project ideation and implementation and will be noted in the ChainLink hackathon. The two person include the solution developer and the video animation developer.

# ChainLink Hackathon Spring 2021
We have entered this project in the Spring 2021 ChainLink hackathon in a manner consistent with there guidelines and recommendations. Our category is a use case of a dedicated [IPFS Node Operation](https://ipfs.io). Our deployment consist of a single module and multi-page website bootstrapped from IPFS and remixed. We pinned the final module to our node to mitigate the risk of interruption. Our planned future development is to enhance the module deliverables with further instruction with a separate page the virtual world gateway instead of embedding. Additionally, we will incorporate our [LMS](https://edu.cybercorps.io) and then add educatonal module as a scope and sequence to the educational curriculum--as approved by the Curriculum Committee. Ideally, prior to the Spring 2022 semester.
